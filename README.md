# Machine Learning Notebooks

This repository contains notebooks for various machine learning (or relevant) tasks and applications (for university courses, personal projects, Kaggle competitions etc.). The notebooks are written in Python and mainly make use of popular libraries such as `pytorch`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `tensorflow`, `statsmodels`.
